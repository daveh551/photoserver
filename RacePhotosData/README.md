This is my first Github attempt, so bear with me.

This is to serve as the photo server layer for a Web site to display pictures of runners at the finish line of a race.

The photo server will allow uploading pictures to the server, store them in a hierarchical directory tree,
extract the EXIF data from them and store it in a database, allow retrieving them, and handle image resizing and possibly overlay a copyright watermark onto the image.
